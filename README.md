# Autonomous Robot Car

Welcome to the Autonomous Robot Car project! This repository contains code and resources for building an autonomous robot car with various capabilities including object detection, robotic arm control, line following, and more.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### Core Components
- **`object_detection/`** - Computer vision and object detection algorithms
- **`robotic_arm/`** - Robotic arm control and kinematics
- **`line_sensor/`** - Line following sensor and algorithms
- **`motor_control/`** - Motor drivers and movement control
- **`sensors/`** - Various sensors (ultrasonic, IMU, GPS, etc.)
- **`communication/`** - Wireless communication and remote control

### Supporting Components
